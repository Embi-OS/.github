# Embi OS
**Welcome to Embi OS - A small Embedded Ecosystem for Raspberry Pi based around Qt/Boot2Qt!**

Embi OS is an open-source embedded ecosystem designed to simplify the development and deployment of applications on embedded devices, with a particular focus on the Raspberry Pi platform. It is a side project developed by [Romain Donz√©](https://github.com/Romain-Donze) in spare time. Development may progress slowly and breaking changes may occurs regularly.

## Project Structure

- **meta-embi:** The open embedded meta-layer providing core configurations and drivers.
- **embi-manifest:** Manifests for open embedded builds.
- **embi-launcher:** Default startup application (manages application deployment).

## Note on Development

Embi OS is more of a personal learning journey. This project serves as a practical exploration and experimentation ground to dive deeper into several key areas. As a side project, development may progress slowly, and breaking changes may be introduced regularly. Your understanding and contributions are highly appreciated!
